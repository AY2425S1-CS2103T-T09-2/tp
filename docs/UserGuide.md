### Introduction


TalentSG is a desktop application designed for HR professionals and recruiters who need to efficiently manage candidates and job roles. Built with productivity in mind, TalentSG is optimized for those who prefer a Command Line Interface (CLI) experience while still benefiting from a Graphical User Interface (GUI). This combination allows users to perform tasks through concise, text-based commands and receive visual feedback for each command executed.

TalentSG streamlines the process of tracking candidates, organizing job roles, and filtering based on status or skillsets. With a flexible command structure, users can work intuitively without having to remember overly complex commands, making TalentSG both powerful and user-friendly.

If youâ€™re a fast typist, TalentSG can significantly speed up your candidate management workflow compared to traditional GUI-only applications. It is especially useful for those who value precision and speed, as the CLI minimizes the clicks and steps required to complete various HR tasks.

This document provides an in-depth guide to using TalentSGâ€™s features and commands, ensuring that users can maximize their experience with the app. We currently support both Windows and Mac operating systems, so feel free to jump to [Quick Start](#quick-start) to begin.

We hope TalentSG becomes an indispensable tool in your recruitment and candidate management journey!

This app is a desktop app for managing candidates and job roles, **optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI)** while still providing the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, this app can help you manage your candidates and job roles faster than traditional GUI apps.

### Archiving Data Files `[coming in v2.0]`

_Details coming soon ..._

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous AddressBook home folder.

**Q**: Help! Double-clicking TalentSG.jar does not launch the application - what should I do?<br>
**A**: Trying running the application from the command line using the following command: `java -jar TalentSg.jar`. Windows users can use the Command Prompt application to do this while Mac users can use the Terminal application.

**Q**: When I minimise the application, the entire application has shrunk and now it is gone! Help!<br>
**A**: Currently our application do not allow diagonal or vertical resizing of the it. It is best not to resize the application at all and leave it as the maximized mode. For the this problem, we suggest that you try to maximise the application from the task manager or try to split the screen with another application so that StudyBuddyPro will resize back to normal. If the mentioned solutions fail, please do download TalentSg again!

**Q**: How do I save my data?<br>
**A**: TalentSG saves your data automatically after every command.

**Q**: How do I update to the latest version of TalentSG?<br>
**A**: Simply download the latest `.jar` file released on our GitHub page.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known Issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
